This book has three portions. Understanding storytelling, making analytical tools using storytelling, and then analyzing a bit of our society with our newly created story cut tools. For each portion I re-imagined (and simplified) several great works.

To dissect stories, I used [Aristotle's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) and [David Mamet's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet) lessons on storytelling.  I put both together to create analytical tools based on their very detailed breakdown on storytelling.

To analyze our world with these story cut tools, I used the work of philosopher [Georg Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel) and biologist [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin). I used Darwin because I think evolution is trillions of individual stories about Life struggling to survive. I used Hegel because he showed how human philosophies are made real via human technological inventions in a process (I find) to be the same as Darwin's evolution.

Putting them all together, I used the storytelling techniques of Aristotle/Mamet to create tools to understand how humanity contributes to life's ongoing evolution on Earth by inventing, adopting (and resisting) new technology. I was happy with it, thought it explained a lot about ourselves, so decided to put it online.
